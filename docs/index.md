We  make accessible open-source happen!
</p>

CAOS supports     disability inclusion in  open-source communities , and   open-source communities that focus on accessibility.  

Open source  helps drive  global equity, but   to benefit everyone,  open-source communities  must be disability-inclusive, and open-source projects must be accessible. 


CAOS   is under construction. Please check back soon.
