# Welcome to CAOS â€” The Center for Accessibility and Open Source

CAOS supports     disability inclusion in  open-source communities , as well as  open-source communities that focus on accessibility.  

Open source  helps drive  global equity, but   to benefit people with disabilities,  open-source communities  must be disability-inclusive, and open-source projects must be accessible. 


We make accessible open-source happen!
