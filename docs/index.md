# The Center for Accessibility and Open Source

The center for accessibility and open source CAOS, aims to be the most trusted global community for resources and information at the intersection of accessibility, disability equity, and open-source.
With the goal of enhancing access to information and opportunity for people with disabilities, the Open Source Accessibility Foundation supports accessibility efforts for open-source projects, as well as the creation and sustenance of open-source accessibility projects.
